# Titanic Dataset EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
In this project, we work with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, carrying out data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to understand the underlying trends in the data, examine the relationships between variables, and highlight any significant patterns that could help explain passenger survival rates.

# Introduction
In this project, we are working with the Titanic dataset, which has information about the passengers who were on the Titanic when it sank in 1912. Our main goal is to clean the data and explore it to find patterns and interesting facts. We will look at things like age, gender, ticket class, and fare to understand what factors may have helped some passengers survive while others did not.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA notebook covers the following:

1 .Data Loading and Overview:
- Load the dataset
- Display the first few rows
- Summarize the dataset
  
2 .Data Cleaning:
- Handle missing values
- Convert categorical variables to numeric
  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
-Univariate analysis (distribution of individual variables)
- Bivariate analysis (relationships between pairs of variables)
- Multivariate analysis (relationships among multiple variables)
